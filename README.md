## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

CSS Grid-template usage, on this challenge, within desktop screen sizes I learned how to use CSS Grid-template to display content which is good for accurate positioning flex boxes. Toggle between desktop and mobile header menu.

### Continued development

CSS Grid is a powerful tool, learning some basics showed me that it has many usage cases. Need to go further on this topic.
